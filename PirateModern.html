            <h2>Exploring Modern Day Pirates</h2>
			<p>The impact of modern-day piracy is significant, affecting global trade, maritime insurance costs, and the safety of seafarers. Piracy incidents can lead to disruptions in shipping routes, delays in cargo delivery, and increased insurance premiums for shipping companies. Furthermore, the threat of piracy creates challenges for naval forces and law enforcement agencies tasked with patrolling vast maritime territories and coordinating international responses to piracy threats. Efforts to combat modern piracy involve a combination of naval patrols, surveillance technologies, legal frameworks such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and international cooperation through initiatives like the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS).</p>
